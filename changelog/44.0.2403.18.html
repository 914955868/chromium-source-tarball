The Chrome team is excited to announce the promotion of Chrome 44 to the beta channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 44.0.2403.18 contains many improvements including:<br /><div><ul><li>A new cadence based rendering algorithm that improves video rendering in Chrome. Users should see much smoother video playback in Chrome for all video content. However, this is especially beneficial for the cases where the system was on the border of playing back certain videos. &nbsp;For example, users who previously had minor stuttering with high resolution or high frame rate content (4k, 1080p60) should now have a smooth playback experience.&nbsp;</li><li>Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance.</li></ul>A full list of changes in this build is available in the&nbsp;<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+log/43.0.2357.73..44.0.2403.18?pretty=fuller&amp;n=10000" target="_blank">log</a>.
